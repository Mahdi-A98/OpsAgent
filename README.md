## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Mahdi-A98/OpsAgent.git
cd OpsAgent

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. (Optional) Install system dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install graphviz graphviz-dev pkg-config
pip install pygraphviz

# 5. Run the app
chainlit run app.py
```

Your OpsAgent will now be running in a Chainlit interface.

Overview:
---
> core/: Contains fundamental abstractions, base agent classes, and shared utilities.

>database_agents/: Handles database operations (queries, migrations, monitoring).

>devops_agents/: Focused on CI/CD, container management, and infrastructure operations.

>public/: Houses any external API endpoints, web interfaces, or shared utilities.

🧠 Modules & Agents
---
- Each “agent” in OpsAgent is designed to handle a specific operational domain.

🔹 Core Agent

- Defines shared logic and communication patterns.

- Provides interfaces for agent discovery and task orchestration.

🔹 Database Agents

- Handle SQL queries, schema migrations, or backups.

- Example: a PostgreSQL management agent or a MongoDB query runner.

🔹 DevOps Agents

- Automate deployments, container tasks, CI/CD workflows, or server operations.

- Example: an agent that runs Docker or Kubernetes commands.

🔹 Adding New Agents

To create a new agent:

- Create a new Python file in the appropriate module (e.g., devops_agents/).

- Implement your class that inherits from a base agent class.

- Register your agent in the main app or discovery system.

- Document your new agent in the README or a dedicated module docstring.

## 🧰 Development Setup

- Branching Strategy: Use feature branches (e.g. feature/new-agent) and open pull requests targeting main.

- Dependencies: Update requirements.txt if you add new libraries.

- Config: Use .env for environment variables and secrets (don’t commit this).

- Logging: Leverage the core logging system for visibility and debugging.

## 💬 Usage Guide

- Once running, interact with OpsAgent via Chainlit.

Example prompts:

-  “Deploy my latest backend service.”

- “Run a query on the user database.”

- “Check container health on Kubernetes.”

- OpsAgent will interpret and execute operational tasks through conversational commands.

## 🤝 Contributing

## ✅ Contributor Checklist

 - Code follows project style (PEP8, docstrings)

 - Tests are added or updated

 - Documentation updated

 - No secrets or credentials included

## 🧪 Code Style & Testing

- Follow PEP8 conventions.

- Use Black or Flake8 for linting and formatting.

- Place tests under a tests/ directory.

- Mock external dependencies to keep tests isolated.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

 - Add network & security agents

 - Implement plugin-based agent architecture

 - Create a web dashboard / visualization layer
